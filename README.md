# Hi, I'm Pomilon

I'm a technology enthusiast and hobbyist who enjoys building projects based on spontaneous ideas. My main interests include Python programming, web technologies, and experimenting with large language models and software concepts.

I tend to approach projects with curiosity and a focus on learning, rather than following a strict plan. Most of my work involves backend logic, interactive web interfaces, and exploring artificial intelligence.

Currently, Most of my repositories are private. While I don't maintain a presence on social platforms, you can find me here on GitHub.
