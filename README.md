# Hi, I'm Pomilon

I'm a university student and technology enthusiast who enjoys building projects based on spontaneous ideas.

I tend to approach coding with curiosity rather than a strict plan. While I started out with web development, lately I've been spending most of my time exploring artificial intelligence and local LLMs. I like figuring out how to make complex software run on my own hardware, usually learning by breaking things along the way.

### Current Status
Most of my active work is currently in private repositories. I'm using them to run personal experiments with autonomous agents, voice interfaces, and game integrations. I prefer to keep these under wraps until they are stable enough to actually use.

### Public Projects
When a project works well enough to share, I put it here.

* **[ManhwaSearch](https://github.com/pomilon/ManhwaSearch)** - A self-hosted scraper and reader I built to keep track of my reading library.
* **[Linux Software Store](https://github.com/pomilon/linux-software-store)** - A lightweight GUI software manager for Linux systems.
* **[Pomilon Intelligence Lab](https://github.com/Pomilon-Intelligence-Lab)** - A separate organization where I host the source code for my experimental AI models.

### Technologies
I mostly work with Python, Node.js, and Docker, using Linux as my primary environment.
