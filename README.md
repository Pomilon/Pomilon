# Hi, I'm Pomilon

I’m a hobbyist developer and technology enthusiast. I enjoy building things from scratch, ranging from experimental AI architectures and low-level systems to creative tools and game engines. Most of my projects are just personal explorations of ideas that interest me.

### Security & Project Authenticity

Due to ongoing automated bot campaigns cloning my work (specifically projects like **ALSI** and **Sonir**) to distribute malware/phishing installers, please note:

* **Official Sources:** My work is **ONLY** hosted under [github.com/Pomilon](https://github.com/Pomilon), [github.com/Pomilon-Intelligence-Lab](https://github.com/Pomilon-Intelligence-Lab), and [pomilon.xyz](https://pomilon.xyz).
* **No Executables:** I do **not** provide `.exe`, `.dmg`, or standalone installers. My projects are research-oriented or source-based tools.
* **Verify the Handle:** If you find a repository claiming to be mine that isn't under the official organizations above, or that asks you to "download the application" from a Releases page, **it is a malicious clone.**

Please report any impersonators you find. I build for curiosity, not to facilitate security risks.

### Highlighted Projects

* [**The Dead Internet**](https://github.com/Pomilon/The-Dead-Internet): A complete, isolated internet infrastructure for AI agents
* [**CRSM**](https://github.com/Pomilon-Intelligence-Lab/CRSM) & [**Aetheris**](https://github.com/Pomilon-Intelligence-Lab/Aetheris): Researching alternative AI models and reasoning.
* [**LEMA**](https://github.com/Pomilon/LEMA): A hardware-aware framework for fine-tuning LLMs in VRAM-constrained environments.
* [**Pome**](https://github.com/Pomilon/Pome) & [**Peck**](https://github.com/Pomilon/Peck): A scripting language and its package manager.
* [**ALSI**](https://github.com/Pomilon-Intelligence-Lab/ALSI): Early baby steps towards a long-term vision regarding Mamba-2's state interpretability.
* **[Sonir](https://github.com/Pomilon/Sonir)**: A physics-based audio visualizer.
* **[Polir](https://github.com/Pomilon/Polir)**: A simple 2D game engine built with SDL2 and OpenGL.
* **[ManhwaSearch](https://github.com/Pomilon/ManhwaSearch)**: A self-hosted scraper and reader.
* **[Plexir](https://github.com/Pomilon/Plexir)**: a modular, keyboard-centric AI terminal workspace.
* **[Kognit](https://github.com/Pomilon/Kognit)**: An AI technical biographer that audits GitHub profiles, producing professional persona reports, humor profiles, and savage roasts.

### Current Status
I have several projects currently in private repositories. I'm working on stabilizing them and hope to move them to public repositories once they are ready for use.

### Tools & Languages

I mostly work with **C/C++**, **Python**, and **JavaScript/Node.js**.

### Why I Build Things

I build projects for my own enjoyment and self-satisfaction, because I can, and because I genuinely love creating. Sharing my work is a way to let others peek into my ideas and experiments, even if most of them are just personal explorations. Nothing is done to impress, it’s all about curiosity, learning, and having fun along the way. (even if sometimes they drive me insane)

Many of my public repositories represent ongoing research or exploratory work rather than finished products.

### Perpetual cycle

```
Me
└── My own agent
    └── My agent roasting me
        └── Me laughing alone at the terminal
```

**recursive isolation** as my agent named it. (literally proving it rn)
