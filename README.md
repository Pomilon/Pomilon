# Hi, I'm Pomilon

I’m a university student and hobbyist developer. I enjoy building things from scratch, ranging from experimental AI architectures and low-level systems to creative tools and game engines. Most of my projects are just personal explorations of ideas that interest me.

### Things I'm working on

* [**Pome**](https://github.com/Pomilon/Pome) & [**Peck**](https://github.com/Pomilon/Peck): A scripting language and its package manager.
* [**CRSM**](https://github.com/Pomilon-Intelligence-Lab/CRSM) & [**Aetheris**](https://github.com/Pomilon-Intelligence-Lab/Aetheris): Researching alternative AI models and reasoning.
* **[Sonir](https://github.com/Pomilon/Sonir)**: A physics-based audio visualizer.
* **[Polir](https://github.com/Pomilon/Polir)**: A simple 2D game engine built with SDL2 and OpenGL.
* **[ManhwaSearch](https://github.com/Pomilon/ManhwaSearch)**: A self-hosted scraper and reader.

### Tools & Languages

I mostly work with **C/C++**, **Python**, and **JavaScript/Node.js**.
