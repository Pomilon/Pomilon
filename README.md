# Hi, I'm Pomilon

I’m a university student and hobbyist developer. I enjoy building things from scratch, ranging from experimental AI architectures and low-level systems to creative tools and game engines. Most of my projects are just personal explorations of ideas that interest me.

### Things I'm working on

* [**Pome**](https://github.com/Pomilon/Pome) & [**Peck**](https://github.com/Pomilon/Peck): A scripting language and its package manager.
* [**CRSM**](https://github.com/Pomilon-Intelligence-Lab/CRSM) & [**Aetheris**](https://github.com/Pomilon-Intelligence-Lab/Aetheris): Researching alternative AI models and reasoning.
* [**ALSI**](https://github.com/Pomilon-Intelligence-Lab/ALSI): Early baby steps towards a long-term vision regarding Mamba-2's state interpretability.
* **[Sonir](https://github.com/Pomilon/Sonir)**: A physics-based audio visualizer.
* **[Polir](https://github.com/Pomilon/Polir)**: A simple 2D game engine built with SDL2 and OpenGL.
* **[ManhwaSearch](https://github.com/Pomilon/ManhwaSearch)**: A self-hosted scraper and reader.
* **[Plexir](https://github.com/Pomilon/Plexir)**: a modular, keyboard-centric AI terminal workspace.
* **[Kognit](https://github.com/Pomilon/Kognit)**: An AI technical biographer that audits GitHub profiles, producing professional persona reports, humor profiles, and savage roasts.

### Current Status
I have several projects currently in private repositories. I'm working on stabilizing them and hope to move them to public repositories once they are ready for use.

### Tools & Languages

I mostly work with **C/C++**, **Python**, and **JavaScript/Node.js**.

### Why I Build Things

I build projects for my own enjoyment and self-satisfaction, because I can, and because I genuinely love creating. Sharing my work is a way to let others peek into my ideas and experiments, even if most of them are just personal explorations. Nothing is done to impress, it’s all about curiosity, learning, and having fun along the way. (even if sometimes they drive me insane)
